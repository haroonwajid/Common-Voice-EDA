## Introduction
The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the Common Voice dataset to understand its features, distribution, and potential biases. By visualizing the data, we can gain insights that may inform future modeling and research efforts in speech recognition.

## Dataset Description
The Common Voice dataset consists of voice recordings contributed by volunteers. It includes:
- **Audio Files**: Recorded speech samples in various languages.
- **Metadata**: Information about the recordings, including speaker demographics, accents, and the text spoken.

### Key Features
- **Languages**: The dataset supports multiple languages, making it suitable for multilingual speech recognition tasks.
- **Speaker Diversity**: Contributions from a wide range of speakers, providing a diverse set of accents and pronunciations.
- **Text Variability**: The dataset includes various phrases, enhancing the model's ability to generalize.

## Installation
To run the EDA notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Common-Voice-Urdu-EDA.git
   cd Common-Voice-Urdu-EDA
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the EDA notebook and run the cells to explore the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA notebook includes various analyses, such as:
- **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and examining its structure.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key statistics of the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Creating plots to visualize the distribution of speakers, languages, and recording lengths.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating relationships between different features.

## Findings
- **Speaker Distribution**: Insights into the number of recordings per speaker and the diversity of accents.
- **Language Representation**: Analysis of the number of recordings available for each language.
- **Recording Lengths**: Examination of the distribution of audio lengths, which can impact model training.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a comprehensive overview of the Common Voice dataset, highlighting its strengths and potential areas for improvement. The insights gained from this analysis can guide future research and development in speech recognition technologies.
